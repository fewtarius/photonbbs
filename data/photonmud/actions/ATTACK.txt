@DATACLR Usage:@THEMECLR
  ATTACK <target>

@DATACLR What it does:@THEMECLR
  ATTACK initiates combat with a monster or player in your current room.
  You must specify the target's name (e.g., ATTACK GOBLIN or ATTACK BOB).
  If multiple targets match, the closest match is chosen.

@DATACLR Rules & Mechanics:@THEMECLR
  - Combat is turn-based. Initiative is rolled (d20 + DEX mod) for all.
  - On your turn, ATTACK performs a standard melee or ranged attack.
  - You may only attack if you are not already in combat.
  - PvP (player vs player) and PvE (player vs monster) are both supported.

@DATACLR Dice Rolls:@THEMECLR
  - Attack Roll: d20 + STR/DEX modifier + proficiency + magic + bonuses
    - Melee: STR/DEX average (rounded down)
    - Ranged: DEX modifier
    - Proficiency: +2 if using your chosen weapon type
    - Magic weapons: add their bonus to hit and damage
  - Target's Armor Class (AC): 10 + DEX mod + armor/shield/magic

@DATACLR Outcome:@THEMECLR
  - If your attack roll >= target's AC, you hit and roll damage.
  - Damage: Weapon dice + STR/DEX mod + proficiency + magic
  - Minimum damage is always 1.
  - If you reduce a monster's HP to 0, it dies and may drop loot.
  - If you reduce a player's HP to 0, they are defeated and respawn.

@DATACLR Class Features:@THEMECLR
  - Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers gain extra attacks at higher levels.
  - Thieves can use BACKSTAB for extra damage (see BACKSTAB).
  - MagicUsers and Clerics may attack, but are less effective in melee.

@DATACLR Tips:@THEMECLR
  - Use LOOK to see who/what is in the room before attacking.
  - Use STATUS to check your own stats and HP.
  - Use SPELLS or special actions for tactical advantage.

@DATACLR Example:@THEMECLR
  ATTACK GOBLIN
    Rolls d20 + bonuses vs. goblin's AC. If hit, rolls weapon damage.
