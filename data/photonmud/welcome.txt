You awaken startled, your head throbbing and your memories a haze.

The ground beneath you is cold, and the air carries the scent of distant
fires, damp earth, and adventure. You have no recollection of how you
arrived in this strange land, nor what fate brought you here. All you
possess are your wits, a few belongings, and a sense that something
important has been set in motion.

Around you, the world stirs: the echo of footsteps in ancient halls,
the whisper of wind through forgotten forests, the clang of steel and
the murmur of magic. Somewhere, heroes rise and fall, treasures await
discovery, and secrets lie buried in shadow.

You are not alone. Others wander these lands-some friend, some foe.
Your journey begins now, shaped by your choices, your courage, and the
path you carve through the unknown.

Will you become a legend, or just another lost soul in the annals of
this realm?
