Detailed Help for SHOP SELL Command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@DATACLR Description:@THEMECLR
  The SHOP SELL command allows players to sell unwanted or excess items
  from their inventory to a shopkeeper in exchange for gold. This command
  is useful for clearing out inventory space and obtaining gold for
  purchasing other items or services.

@DATACLR How to Use:@THEMECLR
  To use the SHOP SELL command, simply type SHOP SELL followed by the
  item you wish to sell. For example, SHOP SELL Potion. If you have
  multiple items to sell, you can list them all in one command, separated
  by commas. For example, SHOP SELL Potion, Sword, Shield.

@DATACLR Shopkeeper Interaction:@THEMECLR
  Once you issue the SHOP SELL command, the shopkeeper will respond with
  an offer for your item(s). You can then choose to accept or decline the
  offer. If you accept, the item(s) will be removed from your inventory
  and you will receive the offered amount of gold. If you decline, the
  item(s) will remain in your inventory and no gold will be exchanged.

@DATACLR Pricing:@THEMECLR
  The price offered by the shopkeeper is typically less than the item's
  market value. The exact amount depends on the item's type, condition,
  and your character's Charisma. High-Charisma characters may receive
  better offers.

@DATACLR Limitations:@THEMECLR
  Not all items can be sold to the shopkeeper. Some rare, unique, or cursed
  items may be refused. Additionally, the shopkeeper may have limited
  gold available, restricting the amount of items you can sell at once.

@DATACLR Tips for Maximizing Profit:@THEMECLR
  - Build up your Charisma to get better prices from the shopkeeper.
  - Consider waiting to sell rare items until you find a buyer who will
  pay closer to the item's true value.
  - Use the MARKET command to check the general value of items before
  selling them to the shopkeeper.
  - Keep an eye out for shopkeepers who specialize in certain types of
  items, as they may offer better prices for those items.

@DATACLR Common Questions:@THEMECLR
  - Q: Can I sell equipped items?
    A: No, you must unequip items before you can sell them.
  - Q: What happens if I sell an item by mistake?
    A: You can try to buy it back from the shopkeeper, but they may not
    have it anymore.
  - Q: Are there any items that I should never sell?
    A: Generally, you should avoid selling quest items, unique items, or
    items with sentimental value. These items may be important for
    completing quests or may have special significance to your character.
